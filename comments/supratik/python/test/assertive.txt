I wish I could have expressed this idea earlier, because now someone else has taken the credit.
Excuse me, first I want to finish my work, then I shall go with you.
I understand you are busy, and me too, but it is difficult for me to finish this project on my own. So, I want you to help me complete this project.
I know this is making you angry and frustrated because you have not gotten a response yet. But I can help you by giving you an estimate of how long it might take.
If you do not finish this work by 6:00 tonight, I I will engage the services of another worker.
I really want to finish this point before you start yours.
