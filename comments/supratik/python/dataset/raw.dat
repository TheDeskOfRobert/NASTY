 
In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

People along with members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards gather around the coffins of Iran's elite Revol...
DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

Amit Mishra's performance at JMC's fest cut short!
In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

People along with members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards gather around the coffins of Iran's elite Revol...
DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

Amit Mishra's performance at JMC's fest cut short!
In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

Jafari in the past has accused Pakistan of harbouring militants and said Iran reserves the right to use force to punish the militants.
Pakistan's foreign office has rejected the accusations.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.

Kareena asks Priyanka not to forget her roots!
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

People along with members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards gather around the coffins of Iran's elite Revol...
DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.

Kareena asks Priyanka not to forget her roots!
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.

Kareena asks Priyanka not to forget her roots!
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will confer its highest civilian honour on the Saudi crown prince on Monday, a day after he signed investment deals worth $20 billion on the first stop of an Asian tour clouded by his alleged role in the grisly murder of a dissident journalist.
Pakistan is facing a serious balance of payments crisis and hopes the huge deals signed over the two-day visit - seven separate agreements and memorandums of understanding - will boost its struggling economy.
Hours ahead of the crown prince's arrival Sunday, Pakistan dismissed Delhi's accusations as "well-rehearsed tactics from (the) Indian playbook after such incidents in the past".
The crown prince, widely known as "MBS", got a warm welcome in Pakistan, including a 21-gun salute and an honour guard.
The Saudis, after initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi's disappearance, finally acknowledged that a team killed him inside the consulate, but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.
Turkey said Friday it has not yet revealed all the information it has uncovered in the case, which launched a global wave of revulsion and tarnished the crown prince's reputation.
Analysts have said the tour is part of a Gulf pivot to rising Asia as a growing oil market, but also a timely demonstration to the West that MBS is not an international pariah.
The crown prince's tour is expected to finish with two days in China on Thursday and Friday.

North Korea is facing a "significant, historic turning point", state media said on Monday, ahead of a highly-anticipated second summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Attention has been focused on whether the US team will offer to lift some economic sanctions on North Korea, in return for Pyongyang taking concrete steps toward denuclearisation.
Earlier this month, US president Trump tweeted that North Korea will become a "great Economic Powerhouse" under Kim.
The Rodong Sinmun commentary called on North Koreans to make greater efforts to boost the country's economy.
North Korea is rising as a "strong, socialist nation," and one's true act of patriotism begins at one's workplace, the commentary added.
In 2017 the UN Security Council banned the North's main exports - coal and other mineral resources, fisheries and textile products - to cut off its access to hard currency in response to Pyongyang's pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.

British lawmakers issued a scathing report Monday that accused Facebook of intentionally violating privacy and anti-competition laws in the UK, and called for greater oversight of social media companies. The report also accuses CEO Mark Zuckerberg of showing contempt for the UK Parliament by declining numerous invitations to appear before the committee.
The report on fake news and disinformation on social media sites followed an 18-month investigation. The parliamentary committee that prepared the report says social media sites should have to follow a mandatory code of ethics overseen by an independent regulator to better control harmful or illegal content.
Facebook did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Facebook and other internet companies have been facing increased scrutiny over how they handle user data and have come under fire for not doing enough to stop misuse of their platforms by groups trying to sway elections.
The report by the Parliament's media committee echoes and expands upon an interim report with similar findings issued by the committee in July . And in December , a trove of documents released by the committee offered evidence that the social network had used its enormous trove of user data as a competitive weapon, often in ways designed to keep its users in the dark.

BEIJING: Facing a future demographic crisis and aging society, China's leaders are desperately seeking to persuade couples to have more children.
But bureaucrats don't seem to have gotten the message, fining a couple in a recent widely publicized case for having a third child against the strict letter of the law.
The Wangs, the couple at the heart of the recent controversy, were ordered by local authorities in Shandong province to pay a fine known as a "social maintenance fee'' of 64,626 yuan ($9,500) immediately after the birth of their third child in January 2017. After various deadlines came and went, the family's entire bank savings of 22,957 yuan ($3,400) were frozen last month, with the balance still due.
The situation the couple faces has its roots in decades-old fears that China's population would outstrip its resources, along with the ruling Communist Party's all-consuming fervor to control people's most personal decisions.
Family planning regulations emerged in the 1970s, and in 1980 the notorious "one-child policy'' came into effect, mandating often brutal punishments for violators ranging from forced abortions and sterilizations to fines and workplace demotions.
Fast-forward 35 years, and a radical change of course was ordered after leaders realized an aging population and declining workforce threatened to hamstring the country's future development. In 2016, the one-child policy was officially replaced with a two-child policy and Chinese couples were urged to go forth and multiply- within limits.
But the bump in the birthrate was fleeting. Last month, the National Bureau of Statistics said the number of new births in 2018 fell to 15.23 million in a total population of 1.395 billion - a growth rate of .381 % and the lowest increase since 1961, resulting in fully 2 million fewer births than in 2017.
China's population is estimated to peak at 1.442 billion in 2029 and then gradually decline, potentially fulfilling the conventional wisdom that China will grow old before it grows rich.
Cases such as the Wangs' remain common, despite a growing recognition of the seriousness of the population crisis, said Yi Fuxian, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and a leading critic of Chinese population policies.
Bureaucratic inertia and the desire of local officials to chase revenue contribute to the problem, Yi said.
Yet the one-child policy has weighed down China with the additional burden of distorted attitudes toward the family, society and childbearing, where one or no children have become the norm, Yi said.
With economic growth the primary guarantor of continued Communist Party rule, the leadership is concerned. The sputtering economy grew at 6.6 percent last year, its slowest pace in three decades, fueling fears over the long-term trend of a shrinking pool of workers paying the pensions and health care costs for a ballooning population of retirees.
Despite that, there remains considerable resistance to lifting controls entirely, something that might give people greater autonomy.
Local bureaucrats in the Wang case said they were just following the law, citing the exact articles and passages. They also have a strong stake in maintaining the rules that justify their jobs and authority.
State media reports say fees meant to compensate for the resources extra children consume actually constitute a large percentage of local governments' discretionary funding _ 15-30 percent _ and can be used for a range of purposes from salaries to travel expenses.
Even if legal changes do go through, experience in recent years shows that's no guarantee of more children.
Families complain of the soaring costs of housing, education, health care and safe food, an important consideration given China's frequent scandals over food and drug safety.
And many young Chinese who are enjoying activities such as foreign travel are simply putting off marriage and childbirth indefinitely.
Boosting fertility will also require reforms to the economy, society and educational system, Yi said in an email.

When President Joko Widodo, who is seeking a second term, asked challenger Prabowo Subianto about his policies for supporting Indonesian unicorns, a look of bafflement passed across the former general's face. Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Wondering aloud, he replied: "What are unicorns? You mean those online things?" Widodo sagely nodded in the affirmative before Subianto explained he supports online businesses.
Subianto was probably not alone in his ignorance, but social media in Indonesia gleefully seized on Sunday night's exchange as proof of his lack of qualification to be president.
In the tech world, a unicorn is a start-up company valued at $1 billion. Indonesia has several of them, and they are transforming areas of the national economy such as transport and shopping.
Twitter and Facebook were awash with unicorn memes after the debate.
In one, juxtaposed photos of Widodo and Subianto with thought bubbles above their heads showed Widodo projecting tech start-up logos and Subianto imagining the magical horned horse creature.
Sunday night's debate was the second of five televised face-offs between the opposing campaigns before April's election.
Opinion polls show Widodo about 20 percentage points ahead of Subianto. The former general, who is campaigning on a Trump-style Indonesia First platform, narrowly lost to Widodo in the 2014 election.

NEAR BAGHOUZ (SYRIA): US President Donald Trump on Sunday called on his European allies to take back alleged jihadis captured in Syria, as Islamic State group militants defended the last scrap of their "caliphate". IS declared a proto-state across parts of Syria and neighbouring Iraq in 2014, but has since lost all of it except a tiny patch of less than half a kilometre square near the Iraqi border.
After years of fighting IS, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) hold hundreds of foreigners accused of fighting for the group, and well as related women and children. Syria's Kurds have repeatedly called for their countries of origin to take them back, but these nations have been reluctant.
The issue has taken on greater urgency, however, amid fears of a security vacuum since Trump's shock announcement in December that US troops would withdraw.
His tweet prompted a reaction from Paris, Brussels and Berlin. In Syria, "it is the Kurds who hold them (the French jihadis) and we have every confidence in their ability to keep them detained," French junior interior minister Laurent Nunez told the BFM news channel. If suspected jihadis return to France, "they will all be tried, and incarcerated," he said. Coalition member France this month opened the door to bringing back its citizens. A French source said an estimated 150 French nationals, including 90 children, could be brought back to France, but authorities have not confirmed any planned transfer.
In Belgium, justice minister Koen Geens called for a collective "European solution" to the problem of foreign fightera, urging a solution that carries the least security risks. "We currently have mothers and children in northern Syria, but also some fighters who are known," he told Belgian public television network VRT. In Germany, foreign ministry sources said "the federal government is examining options to enable German citizens to leave Syria, especially in humanitarian cases".

Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack.
TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.
Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.
The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.

Mateusz Morawiecki canceled his plans to attend a meeting of central European leaders in Israel starting Monday amid new tensions over how Polish behavior during the Holocaust is remembered and characterized.
Dworczyk, who heads the prime minister's chancellery, said. Poland's foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, plans to attend instead, he said.
Dworczyk did not give a reason for the prime minister's cancellation. But Polish officials had threatened to pull out of the meeting after the Israeli leader made an off-hand comment about the Holocaust and Poland while in Warsaw on Thursday.
Netanyahu said during a Middle East conference hosted by the United States and Poland that "Poles cooperated with the Nazis" - wording suggesting some Poles participated in killing Jews during the German occupation of Poland.
He was initially quoted by the Jerusalem Post as saying "the Poles," which could be taken as blaming the entire Polish nation.
Both Netanyahu's office and the newspaper said he was misquoted due to an editing error. The Polish government summoned the Israeli ambassador on Friday and later said it was not satisfied with the explanation of the Israeli leader being quoted incorrectly.
Warsaw and Jerusalem had a major spat last year over a new Polish law that made it illegal to blame the Polish nation for collaboration in the Holocaust.
The dispute sparked an explosion of anti-Semitic hate speech in Poland, and there were signs of another spike in recent days.

In spite of Donald Trump's claim that Japanese PM Shinzo Abe had given him "the most beautiful copy" of a 5-page nomination letter to the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Abe is not saying whether or not he nominated Trump for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, but the question may be moot: the US president has been put forward by others for the prestigious award.
Since then Abe has declined to say whether he had done so. Regardless, Trump has already been nominated by two Norwegian lawmakers.
Amundsen, who is a member of the rightwing Progress Party, wrote a letter to the award committee together with his parliamentary colleague Christian Tybring-Gjedde, he said.
The letter was submitted in June, immediately after a summit Trump held in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un aimed at easing tensions and tackling Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
Tybring-Gjedde, who sits on the Norwegian Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, also confirmed the joint nomination of Trump when contacted by Reuters.
A wide range of people can nominate for the Nobel Peace Prize, including members of parliaments and governments, heads of state, university professors of history, social sciences or law and past Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
The deadline for nominations for the 2019 prize, which will be announced on Oct 11, was Jan 31.
The five-strong Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides who wins the award, does not comment on nominations, keeping secret for 50 years the names of nominators and unsuccessful nominees.
Still, it did say earlier this month that 304 candidates were nominated for this year's prize, of which 219 are individuals and 85 are organisations.
Last year's prize was jointly awarded to Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege and Yazidi human rights activist Nadia Murad.

BEIJING: China's government on Monday accused the United States of trying to block its industrial development by alleging that Chinese mobile network gear poses a cybersecurity threat to countries rolling out new internet systems.
And in a potential blow to the US's effort to rally its allies on the issue, British media reported that the country's intelligence agencies have found it's possible to limit the security risks of using Chinese equipment in so-called 5G networks.
The US argues that Beijing might use Chinese tech companies to gather intelligence about foreign countries. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on allies to shun networks supplied by Huawei Technologies, threatening the company's access to markets for next-generation wireless gear.
The company, the biggest global maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies, denies accusations it facilitates Chinese spying and said it would reject any government demands to disclose confidential information about foreign customers.
The 5G technology is meant to vastly expand the reach of networks to support internet-linked medical equipment, factory machines, self-driving cars and other devices. That makes it more politically sensitive and raises the potential cost of security failures.
In what could amount to a turning point for the US effort to isolate Huawei, Britain's National Cyber Security Centre has found that the risk of using its networks is manageable, according to the Financial Times and several other British media outlets.
The reports cited anonymous sources as saying that there are ways to limit cybersecurity risks, and that the UK's decision would carry weight with European allies who are also evaluating the safety of their networks.
The US Justice Department last month unsealed charges against Huawei, its chief financial officer — who had been arrested in Canada — and several of the companies' subsidiaries, alleging not only violation of trade sanctions but also the theft of trade secrets.
The United States has not, however, released evidence to support its accusations that Huawei and other Chinese tech companies allow the Chinese government to spy through their systems. That has prompted some industry analysts to suggest Washington is trying to use security concerns to handicap Chinese competitors.

For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer. But, since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape.

ABADIANIA (BRAZIL): For over 40 years, spiritual healer Joao Teixeira de Faria drew people from all over the world to this small city in central Brazil, offering treatment for everything from depression to cancer.
His work was both praised — Oprah Winfrey called de Faria "inspiring" while visiting in 2012 — and heavily scrutinized. Now, de Faria, who goes by the name "Joao de Deus," or "John of God," is in trouble with the law.
Since December, more than 250 women including his daughter have come forward to allege abuse that ranged from being felt up during treatments to rape. The mounting accusations are turning the 77-year-old spiritual guru into Brazil's first major figure to go down in the (hash)metoo era, which has been slow to take off in Latin America's largest nation despite myriad problems with gender equality.
Meanwhile, the people in Abadiania, about a two-hour drive west from the nation's capital of Brasilia, are in disbelief. They also fear for their futures without de Faria.
Indeed, de Faria's pull was so strong that the much more affluent "new" part of the town, built in the years since the healer opened his clinic in 1976, stands in sharp contrast to the older, run down part of town: There are brightly colored houses, swept streets, hotels with ATM machines inside — a rarity in small Brazilian cities — as well as specialty boutiques that cater to tourists and police constantly patrolling.
By some estimates, his "casa spiritual," or "spiritual house," attended to 10,000 patients a week. It was there that de Faria, who over the decades came under sharp scrutiny from critics who deemed him a charlatan, performed "psychic" surgeries that he said could heal a wide range of maladies.
Sometimes treatments were based on prayer, and sometimes they involved minor cutting into the body.
In 2012, Winfrey visited de Faria's center and interviewed him for her talk show, writing about the experience of seeing him cut into the breast of a woman without anesthesia.
Winfrey has issued a statement saying she sympathizes with the alleged victims and hopes they get justice.
According to more than 250 women, it was during the healing sessions that de Faria molested them or began grooming them for what would lead to forced sexual contact outside the clinic.
De Faria's victims were of all ages, and he would often begin by turning off the lights and asking for a massage, Miranda said.
The scandal erupted when several women talked about their experiences on the show "Conversa com Bial" in December, leading to an avalanche of similar accusations in the weeks that followed.
The US Embassy in Brazil published an alert asking Americans to contact Brazilian authorities if they had been abused by de Faria.
De Faria's adult daughter, Dalva Teixeira, told Brazilian magazine Veja that her father frequently raped her between the ages of 10 and 14, all on the pretense of spiritual treatments.
De Faria's lawyers have noted that many of the allegations are decades old, and in some cases involved women who repeatedly visited the healer _ putting into question the veracity of their abuse claims.
They argue their client, who has been arrested, should be released before a trial. They have called on Brazilians to know all the facts before judging.
The accusations against de Faria come as cases of alleged abuse have emerged in several Latin American countries. In Argentina, a well-known actor, a senator and a legislative chief of staff have been accused of sexual harassment to assault. In Costa Rica, a criminal complaint alleging sexual assault was filed against former president and Nobel peace laureate Oscar Arias, leading other women to come forward with accusations.
Of the women who made the initial accusations on "Conversa com Bial," only one agreed to be identified. Zahira Lieneke Mous, a Danish choreographer, recounted how she visited de Faria to deal with sexual abuse in her past.
During a first consultation, she said he placed her hands on his penis, and in a second encounter penetrated her from behind. After remaining silent for four years, she detailed her accusations in a Facebook post last year and told her story on the show. Contacted since then, Mous has declined to be interviewed.
Two other alleged victims reached by the AP have also declined to give interviews.
In Abadiania, where many express surprise at the allegations against de Faria, the married guru was seen around town as a lady's man.
Norberto Kist, another inn owner who often assisted de Faria, said the man he considered a "father" was attractive to women.
Inside de Faria's spiritual hospital is a picture of Jesus Christ next to one of de Faria. Signs in English and Portuguese give instructions like, "Crystal bed in session. Silence please." Inside the center, both workers and tourists dress in all white.
By all accounts, the number of visitors is way down, but the flow hasn't stopped entirely.
Of the more than 250 cases, at least 112 have passed the statue of limitations, said Miranda, the public prosecutor. In such cases, it's normally 20 years, but de Faria's advanced age reduces the statute of limitations to 10 years.
No trial date has been set, but regardless of what happens, it's unlikely de Faria will ever be able to practice again.

United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
In a direct challenge to Corbyn, the seven centrist MPs said they were courting others from across parliament to join their group, saying "enough is enough" in keeping silent over their doubts about the Labour leader's fitness for office.
United by a desire for a second referendum on Britain's decision to leave the European Union, now that the likely terms of the divorce are known, they acknowledged that their move would not change the arithmetic in parliament, where there is as yet no majority for such a so-called "People's Vote".
But their move underlines the increasing frustration within Labour over Corbyn's reluctance to change his Brexit strategy - the leftist leader and long-time critic of the EU has stuck to his preference for a new election or his plan to leave the bloc.
With only 39 days until Britain leaves the EU, its biggest foreign and trade policy shift in more than 40 years, divisions over Brexit have fragmented British politics, breaking down traditional party lines and creating new ad hoc coalitions.
Corbyn expressed his disappointment that the group had left, referring in a statement to "Labour policies that inspired millions at the last election" when the opposition party saw its biggest increase in vote share since 1945 to win 262 seats.
But the seven may only be the start of a bigger exodus, a Labour source close to the group said. That, critics say, could split the party and hand almost certain victory to the governing Conservatives in any new election.
Britain's 2016 EU referendum, in which 52 percent voted to leave versus 48 percent to remain, has split not only British towns and villages but also parliament, with both Conservative and Labour leaders struggling to keep their parties united.
Eurosceptics in Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party flexed their muscle by voting against her government in a symbolic Brexit ballot last week but have so far given little sign of formally breaking away.
But lawmakers in the new Labour independent grouping may hope to tempt away some pro-EU members of the governing party and said they were holding talks across parliament.
Corbyn has so far stuck to Labour policy to keep the option of a second referendum "on the table" if May's government fails to secure a deal with Brussels that can pass through parliament.
The deal's perceived failure either to make a clean break from the EU or keep close economic ties with the UK's main trade partner has united eurosceptic and pro-EU MPs against it.
The prospect of holding a second referendum poses a dilemma for Corbyn: while many of the party's members fervently back a so-called People's vote, others just want Britain to leave as soon as possible.
But it was clear that for the seven lawmakers launching the new group, Corbyn's wider beliefs had spurred them to leave the party, which for several of them had been the basis of life-long political careers.
Corbyn has cemented a shift to the left in Labour, taking control of a party that, under former prime minister Tony Blair, moved to the centre to win and keep power for 13 years.
Some accused Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party, an allegation that has dogged the Labour chief, a supporter of Palestinian rights and critic of the Israeli government, since he took over the party in 2015. Corbyn denies the allegation, saying he is stamping anti-Semitism out.
Luciana Berger, a Jewish lawmaker who has faced abuse, said the party had become "institutionally anti-Semitic" and that the leadership has "willfully and repeatedly failed to address hatred against Jewish people in its ranks".
For others, Corbyn was just not up to the demands of his office, they said. "This is a Labour Party which has changed beyond recognition," Mike Gapes said.

A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard. Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
ISLAMABAD: A senior Saudi diplomat on Monday fired back after Iran initially blamed the kingdom for an attack last week that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard.
Adel al-Jubeir, the minister of state for foreign affairs, called Iran a "chief sponsor of terrorism," saying its allegations sought to divert the attention of the Iranian people from the country's own troubles.
The comments came as Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was concluding a two-day visit to Pakistan. Al-Jubeir, the kingdom's former foreign minister, is part of the prince's entourage.
Iranian officials had at first said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were behind Wednesday's bombing near the Pakistani border, but later said the attack was planned from "inside Pakistan." The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl, which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.
Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi told his Iranian counterpart on Sunday that Islamabad would fully cooperate in the investigation into the attack on the Revolutionary Guard. Pakistan has also pledged to act if Tehran shares evidence against those linked to the attack.
On Monday, three Pakistani security officials said a search operation was underway in remote southwestern regions bordering Iran in an effort to arrest suspects linked to attacks in Pakistan and Iran. They said the security forces were searching areas where Tehran believed insurgents responsible for last week's attack might be hiding.
The officials said the operation began Sunday and was expanded after militants killed six Pakistani paramilitary troops in two attacks in the southwestern towns of Turbat and Loralai.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief media, said Pakistani and Iranian officials have been in touch since the attack.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia signed agreements worth $20 billion to help Pakistan overcome its financial crisis.
Pakistan voiced support for the prince during the international outcry after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in October. The kingdom has long provided aid to Pakistan, and signed an agreement for a $6 billion assistance package after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan attended an investment conference that month that saw a wave of cancellations linked to the Khashoggi killing.
Pakistani President Arif Alvi on Monday conferred the country's highest civilian honor on the Saudi crown prince, who left Pakistan amid tight security. Khan drove the prince to the airport.
Prince Mohammad is expected to travel onward to neighboring India, which has warned Pakistan of a "crushing response" to the suicide bombing of a paramilitary convoy in Indian-controlled Kashmir that killed 41 people on Thursday.
In a joint statement Monday, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia reiterated their commitment to continue combating extremism and terrorism and promoting peace in Afghanistan.

The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
The arrest came after the Criminal Court began a hearing into allegations that Yameen received nearly $1.5 million in illicit payments just before he lost an election in September and was forced out of power.
If convicted, the 59-year-old could face up to 15 years in jail and be fined three times the amount of the fraud involved.
Yameen, who came to power in 2013 and jailed many of his opponents or forced them into exile, was summoned to the Criminal Court Sunday to formally receive his indictment. He sent his lawyers in his place.
The court then scheduled a rushed hearing after prosecutors told judge Ahmed Hailam that Yameen was attempting to interfere with witnesses.
Since Yameen's shock election defeat, all dissidents have returned to the Indian Ocean archipelago and most have had their convictions overturned.
During his five-year tenure, Yameen relied heavily on China for political and financial support as he came under international criticism over his dismal human rights record.
The nation of 340,000 Sunni Muslims is now heavily in debt to China.
Authorities believe millions of dollars allegedly siphoned off by Yameen could be stashed abroad, and have said that talks are under way with foreign entities to repatriate any cash found.
The court has already frozen Yameen's local bank accounts holding about $6.5 million, a decision the former leader has contested.
Last week, an anti-corruption body came up with a report saying $79 million was embezzled from state-run Maldives Media and Public Relations Corporation during Yameen's tenure.
There was no immediate comment from Yameen or his legal team on the detention order.
The arrest of Yameen came a day after his chief lawyer and former justice minister Azima Shakoor was also charged with embezzlement and helping her boss to launder money.
Maldivian police earlier announced they had evidence linking Yameen and Shakoor to the theft of millions from the country.
The Maldives was on the verge of being slapped with Western-led sanctions before opposition leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won an unexpected landslide in last year's election, campaigning on a pledge to end corruption in the country otherwise known for its luxury tourism.

DUBAI: Revolutionary Guards have broken up a group of militants in southeast Iran who were linked to a suicide bombing that killed 27 guards near the border with Pakistan last week, the Corps said on Monday.
Three militants were arrested and explosive material was seized from houses in the cities of Saravan and Khash, it said.
The Sunni group Jaish al Adl (Army of Justice), which says it seeks greater rights and better living conditions for the ethnic minority Baluchis, claimed responsibility for the attack.
Iranian authorities also accuse regional rival Sunni Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of financially supporting militant Sunni groups that attack Iranian forces. Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the UAE deny backing such militants.
Iran summoned the Pakistani ambassador to protest the attack.

Avijit Roy, a Bangladesh-born US national, was hacked to death by machete-wielding assailants in February 2015 while returning home with his wife from a Dhaka book fair. His wife, Rafida Ahmed, was seriously injured.
DHAKA: Six persons, including a sacked army major, were charged in Bangladesh on Monday with the gruesome murder of a controversial atheist blogger four years ago.
Of the accused, Ziaul Haq and Akram Hossain aka Abir are absconding. The remaining four are currently in prison.
Investigators say all of the suspects, aside from Farabi, were members of the Ansarullah Bangla Team.
The counter-terror unit's investigation found that 11 people were connected to the incident.
Investigators found the organisational aliases of the ten perpetrators, but have not been able to uncover the names and addresses of five of them.
Al Qaeda and Islamic State had claimed responsibility for a series of killings in Bangladesh over the past few years, including that of Roy. However, the government has denied the presence of such groups, blaming domestic militants instead.
